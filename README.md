# CapsNet
This is an implementation of CapsNet in Keras.

CapsNet is based on this paper:
 [Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)   
 
The original code in this repo is based heavily on XifengGuo's implementation here:
 [XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras/) 

The intention of this version is to build out a Keras implementation that is flexible for other datasets and different types of routing.
